    <h1>SAVE THEM</h1>
    <H3>The education system of the Indian subcontinent</H3>
    <P>Today I am going to share a story with you. It’s not like normal stories it will be very different. It’s about me and my one friend. My friend was a topper in our class even he is now. And I was an very average student. I liked to image or feel the things that I read rather than memorizing. About what was taught in the class I tried learn more stuffs about that like, I research that topic. On the other hand, my friend only read only that are on the exam.
    </P>
    <p>Again, our final exam came and my that friend secures his top position in the exam. Like every time again I got very average marks. My parents was very frustrated with me.
    </p>
    <p>One day, I have talk about his strategy. And you will be glad to that he said me that, If I want to secure a top position in exam I have memorize every stuff in the syllabus. He tells me more that he even memorizes mathematics! After that day I talked to many of my friend who are topper in there school. You can’t believe they all said the same that about memorizing all stuffs.
    </p>
    So what’s the problem here is there is scientifically proven that if you memorizing a lot without understanding you can loss your learning capacity.

    <p>You might be thinking, what can they do here because if they want to pass in the exam they have to memorize some stuffs. But, no; I am not blaming them I am blaming the national education system of Bangladesh. I pushes a student to memorize stuffs. There are some education system that are mainly focused on practical and real-life applying approach. But, I am not talking about that. I am talking about the national education system of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal etc (the countries there education system are very similar with Bangladesh.
    </p>
    <p>I want to make an organization to help the students they are got stuck by memorizing things. Already I had talked with some people. So I am seeking for your help to make a organization that can make a relief to the students. I know it’s going to be hard. But although, ‘Teamwork is a, dream work!’ Please, support me at, <a id="keu na" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=rm&ogbl#inbox?compose=new">anindyaprofessional122521@gmail.com
